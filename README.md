# Balderdoush

Remake of `Balderdoush`, a puzzle game initially developed by Georges Lobry (released for the Macintosh in 1994). Adapted from the Commodore Game `Boulder Dash`, this game has 20 caves (some very difficult) which you have to get through. In other words, hours of fun.

Development in progress.
